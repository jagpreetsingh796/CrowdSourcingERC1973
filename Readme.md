# Description
I plan to use crowdsourcing for the purpose of vacation.Crowdsourcing has changed the way people travel.The most obvious it has impacted is through logistics.Services like AirBnB, Uber, and what has been dubbed the “sharing economy” turned what had been primarily a mass-produced transactional experience into a peer-to-peer economic network. In past decades travellers depended on known brands to provide reliable, consistent experiences (taxis, hotels), these days they are just as likely to tap away.

# Working
 * On this crowdsourcing platform praticipants would get tokens which they can redeem for erc20 tokens .
 
 * They can exchange these tokens for stablecoins.
 
 * It is going to be milestone based.The milestones would be 10 ether,20 ether,30 ether.

 * These milestones are determined based on the requirement of the user.
 
 * After each milestone is completed 1000 tokens would be released and distributed to the participants in the network.
 
 * They can redeem these stable coins with a partenered retailer.

* The token to stable coin ratio is one to one

* So if there are 100 participants initially when the first milestone was completed the mask is calculated and the tokens are distributed

* The retailers can cash out the stable coins with me for some commision
