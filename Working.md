# Description
I plan to use crowdsourcing for the purpose of vacation.Crowdsourcing has changed the way people travel.The most obvious it has impacted is through logistics.Services like AirBnB, Uber, and what has been dubbed the “sharing economy” turned what had been primarily a mass-produced transactional experience into a peer-to-peer economic network. In past decades travellers depended on known brands to provide reliable, consistent experiences (taxis, hotels), these days they are just as likely to tap away.

# Working
 * On this crowdsourcing platform praticipants would get tokens which they can redeem for air miles .
 
 * It is going to be milestone based.The milestones would be 10 ether,20 ether,30 ether.

 * These milestones are determined based on the requirement of the user.
 
 * After each milestone is completed 1000 tokens would be released and distributed to the participants in the network.
 
 * They can redeem these tokens with any retailers.

 * The token to air mile ratio is determined by the retailer with   whom you are redeeming them

 * So if there are 100 participants initially when the first milestone was completed the mask is calculated and the tokens are distributed

 * So as the number of tokens increase the reward share of each user decreases.The early bird reap much of the reward.
